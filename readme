Testing is a testing repo.

It is used mainly for testing.

Testing is an interesting activity.

To make sure you understand a concept, one must test their understanding.

The testing process reveals many details that are usually overlooked.

You start with the fundementals, with the most basic ideas.

It is very important not to overwhelm one's self with concepts and ideas. It is enough to tackle one idea at a time, till one masters it.
Testing one basic principle at a time, that is how I usually do it.

I must say, you will feel that you are not progressing much, and that you need to take in more info.

Patience and perspective are very important qualities to keep throughout your learning process
